**Overview**

The IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate is a comprehensive 8-course program designed to equip individuals with the core skills of data analysis. Throughout the program, I learned how to:

- Collect, clean, and analyze data using tools like Excel, SQL, and Python.
- Visualize data with tools such as Tableau and Power BI.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis.
- Work with databases and analyze real-world data.
- Understand key concepts in data analysis, including data wrangling, data visualization, and creating insightful reports.

  
**Projects and Assignments**
This repository contains the following projects from the course:

-Data Cleaning with Python and Pandas

-Analyzing and cleaning real-world datasets using Python and Pandas.
SQL Queries for Data Analysis

-Writing SQL queries to extract and analyze data from databases.
-Data Visualization with Tableau

-Creating interactive and insightful visualizations using Tableau.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Performing EDA using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to uncover insights from raw data.

**Capstone Project**
